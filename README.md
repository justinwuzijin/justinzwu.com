- take pics of polaroids + receipts + objects in my bedroom  -> build out art gallery
- take pics of journal pages and excerpts & make drawer of thoughts  feel like a journal -- w/ orange sticky notes, sharpie effect, cut-out scrapbook collage art cool serenali typebeat
- pre-footer image can be edited user side (like figma UI)

        
would be cool:
